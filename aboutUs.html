        <h2>Where It All Started?</h2>
        <p>The Eleos's Charitable wing started with a very little initiative of giving small gifts on the occasions to the less privileged section of our society around us. Gradually we gathered a large number of people which required nurture in abundance and hence the charity wing was form to collectively help the society. </p>
